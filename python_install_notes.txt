For OSX Mountain Lion from https://github.com/edx/discern/wiki/Setup-Guide#wiki-mac.

Mac OS X
Preparation

1.Setup Xcode with Command Line Tools

Install XCode from the Apple App Store Version 4.5 or later

In XCode, Go to Preferences -> Download ->"Command Line Tools" -> Click Install button

2.Install Homebrew:

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL http://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
3.Install Python

brew install python --universal --framework
4.Install pip

easy_install pip
5.Install virtualenv

pip install virtualenv
6.Getting started with Virtualenv

cd to/where/you/want/env/to/be

virtualenv --no-site-packages discern-venv

source bin/activate
Now you should see (discern-venv) on your command line.

Installation

Installing numpy and **scipy* independently will avoid unnecessary troubles.

pip install numpy==1.6.2
pip install scipy==0.11.0
If you bump into following error when installing scipy

error: library dfftpack has Fortran sources but no Fortran compiler found
On Lion, you have to run

brew edit gfortran
Change

if MacOS.xcode_version >= '4.2' and MACOS_VERSION == 10.7
    ohai "Installing gfortran 4.2.4 for XCode 4.2 (build 5666)"
to:

if MacOS.xcode_version >= '4.2' and MACOS_VERSION >= 10.7
    ohai "Installing gfortran 4.2.4 for XCode 4.2 (build 5666) or higher"
On Mountain Lion, you don't have to do above steps. Just run the following command:

brew install gfortran
Then you could just cd to the discern repo and run following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you get this error when trying to install scipy:

numpy.distutils.npy_pkg_config.PkgNotFound: Could not find file(s) ['/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/lib/npy-pkg-config/npymath.ini']
Then you need to install numpy not using pip, due to a bug documented here.

Run the following commands after you've activated your virtualenv::

$ git clone git@github.com:numpy/numpy.git
$ git checkout maintenance/1.6.x
$ python setup.py install
The last line of output should look something like this:

copying build/temp.macosx-10.8-x86_64-2.7/libnpymath.a -> /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/lib
